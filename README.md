## About the project

Pub Menu is an application that allows a user to see information about a single beer, and if they wish to, to see foods that will go well with that beer. The user can view additional beers, and can add any that they like to a favorite list. the favorite list can be viewed if the user wishes.

This was a solo project assigned during the third module of the Front-End Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. I was tasked with selecting an API, utilizing the React Library, the Jest testing Library, and using React Router to give the user a multi-page experience.

The learning goals for this project were to create an application from start to finish without specific instructions as to what the functionality should be, to demonstrate knoweldge of React, Router and Asynchronous JavaScript and to incorporate data from an API that we chose.

### Built With
* React
* JavaScript
* CSS/HTML
* React Router
* Jest


## Successes:
  I was particularly pleased to get the integration test set up and passing. I normally find working independtly much more difficult than paired programming, but this app came together pretty easily working on my own, which is a bit win for me.

## Challenges:
  The project was assigned over a particularly stressful election, and I found focussing on the work to be a definite challenge. This was the first time that I have used integration testing, and it did take some time to figure that out.

## Next Steps
I would have liked to have sad path testing accomplished, and there are definitely some bugs that I would like to have addressed, if I had more time. The app allows multiple instances of the same item in favorites, and does not function properly using the back arrow buttons. All of those things need to be addressed to allow for a properly functional app.
I will also need to complete styling in several areas. The styling was only accomplished to a very basic level needed for the user to interact with the app.
